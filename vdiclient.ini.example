# The Spice Proxy provided by the Proxmox API may need to have its host/port rewritten
# These rewrite rules are written `IP:port = IP:port`
# 1. Use the inidebug and read the current proxy=pve1.example.com:3128
# 2. Add your proxmox ip to the right side e.g. 123.123.123.123:6000
pve1.example.com:3128 = 123.123.123.123:6000
